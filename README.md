# COMP 163: Assignment 6 - Contact Information Formatter

## Project Overview

This program's objective is to read inconsistent contact information (names, phone numbers, emails, addresses) and use string methods to clean and format everything into a professional directory format. The program must handle common data entry errors and produce consistent, properly formatted output. The final output must use precise alignment.

---

## Implementation Details and Required Methods

The program processes contact information by cleaning and standardizing four fields: name, phone, email, and address. All input is assumed to contain exactly 4 fields (`name|phone|email|address`).

### Required String Methods Used

The solution explicitly uses the following string methods as mandated by the assignment:

* **.split('|')** and **.split()**
* **.join()**
* **.strip()**
* **.title()**
* **.upper()**
* **.lower()**
* **.replace()**
* **.isdigit()**
* **.isalpha()**
* **F-string formatting** with alignment for precise output.
